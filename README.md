# bellybutton

We helped develop a visual, interactive webpage were we could present our findigs regarding the bacteria cultures found on people's belly buttons. This project has the goal to find the perfect bacteria to synthesize into a flavorfull meat alternative that people can enjoy. 

In our webpage, you can play around with ID's to find the different types of bacteria found in their belly buttons, as well as other interesting facts such as how frequently they wash their belly buttons. (LOL)
